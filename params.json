I have it set to one second for dramatic demo effect.\r\n\r\nThis does not require any JS to work. It is all CSS and HTML. You just need to be able to add the class \"show-rounded-loading-spinner\" to show the loader and remove that class to hide it.\r\n\r\nI have added some simple jQuery to show how it works.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
